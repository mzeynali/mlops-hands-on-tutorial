# MLOps Hands On Tutorial
MLOps, or Machine Learning Operations, is a set of practices and tools that aim to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently. It bridges the gap between data science and operations, enabling seamless integration of machine learning models into existing software systems. MLOps incorporates DevOps principles with machine learning workflows, ensuring continuous integration, continuous deployment (CI/CD), monitoring, and scalability of models.

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to MLOps, covering the essential components such as model versioning, data management, automated pipelines, deployment strategies, and monitoring techniques. Whether you're a data scientist looking to operationalize your models or a developer wanting to integrate machine learning into your applications, this guide provides the tools and knowledge to implement effective MLOps practices.

**Note: Please raise an issue for any suggestions, corrections, and feedback.**

The goal of the series is to understand the basics of MLOps like model building, monitoring, configurations, testing, packaging, deployment, CICD, etc.

## Week 4: Model Packaging - ONNX

<img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1.svg?style=for-the-badge&label=difficulty&message=medium&color=orange"/>

Refer to the [Blog Post here](https://medium.com/@mzeynali01/converting-and-running-machine-learning-models-with-onnx-141ef66d527b)

Why do we need model packaging? Models can be built using any machine learning framework available out there (sklearn, tensorflow, pytorch, etc.). We might want to deploy models in different environments like (mobile, web, raspberry pi) or want to run in a different framework (trained in pytorch, inference in tensorflow).
A common file format to enable AI developers to use models with a variety of frameworks, tools, runtimes, and compilers will help a lot.

This is acheived by a community project `ONNX`.

The scope of this week is to understand the following topics:

- `What is ONNX?`

- `How to convert a trained model to ONNX format?`

- `What is ONNX Runtime?`

- `How to run ONNX converted model in ONNX Runtime?`

- `Comparisions`

## Week 5: Model Packaging - Docker

<img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1.svg?style=for-the-badge&label=difficulty&message=easy&color=green"/>

Refer to the [Blog Post here](https://medium.com/@mzeynali01/week-5-understanding-docker-and-docker-compose-13fc15e48209)

Why do we need packaging? We might have to share our application with others, and when they try to run the application most of the time it doesnâ€™t run due to dependencies issues / OS related issues and for that, we say (famous quote across engineers) that `It works on my laptop/system`.

So for others to run the applications they have to set up the same environment as it was run on the host side which means a lot of manual configuration and installation of components.

The solution to these limitations is a technology called Containers.

By containerizing/packaging the application, we can run the application on any cloud platform to get advantages of managed services and autoscaling and reliability, and many more.

The most prominent tool to do the packaging of application is Docker ðŸ›³

The scope of this week is to understand the following topics:

- `FastAPI wrapper`
- `Basics of Docker`
- `Building Docker Container`
- `Docker Compose`

## Week 6: CI/CD - GitHub Actions

<img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1.svg?style=for-the-badge&label=difficulty&message=medium&color=orange"/>

Refer to the [Blog Post here](https://medium.com/@mzeynali01/week-6-exploring-github-actions-automating-workflows-and-building-docker-containers-8fcf03dff1a2)

CI/CD is a coding philosophy and set of practices with which you can continuously build, test, and deploy iterative code changes.

This iterative process helps reduce the chance that you develop new code based on a buggy or failed previous versions. With this method, you strive to have less human intervention or even no intervention at all, from the development of new code until its deployment.

In this post, I will be going through the following topics:

- Basics of GitHub Actions
- First GitHub Action
- Creating Google Service Account
- Giving access to Service account
- Configuring DVC to use Google Service account
- Configuring Github Action

## Week 7: Container Registry - AWS ECR

<img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1.svg?style=for-the-badge&label=difficulty&message=medium&color=orange"/>

Refer to the [Blog Post here](https://medium.com/@mzeynali01/week-7-automating-container-deployment-with-aws-ecr-and-github-actions-4a2f66f0268c)

A container registry is a place to store container images. A container image is a file comprised of multiple layers which can execute applications in a single instance. Hosting all the images in one stored location allows users to commit, identify and pull images when needed.

Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a storage for the internet. It is designed for large-capacity, low-cost storage provision across multiple geographical regions.

In this week, I will be going through the following topics:

- `Basics of S3`

- `Programmatic access to S3`

- `Configuring AWS S3 as remote storage in DVC`

- `Basics of ECR`

- `Configuring GitHub Actions to use S3, ECR`

## Week 8: Serverless Deployment - AWS Lambda

<img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1.svg?style=for-the-badge&label=difficulty&message=medium&color=orange"/>

Refer to the [Blog Post here](https://medium.com/@mzeynali01/week-8-configure-aws-lambda-with-a-docker-image-and-invoke-via-api-575253634b27)

A serverless architecture is a way to build and run applications and services without having to manage infrastructure. The application still runs on servers, but all the server management is done by third party service (AWS). We no longer have to provision, scale, and maintain servers to run the applications. By using a serverless architecture, developers can focus on their core product instead of worrying about managing and operating servers or runtimes, either in the cloud or on-premises.

In this week, I will be going through the following topics:

- `Basics of Serverless`

- `Basics of AWS Lambda`

- `Triggering Lambda with API Gateway`

- `Deploying Container using Lambda`

- `Automating deployment to Lambda using Github Actions`

## Week 9: Prediction Monitoring - Kibana

<img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1.svg?style=for-the-badge&label=difficulty&message=medium&color=orange"/>

Refer to the [Blog Post here](https://medium.com/@mzeynali01/a-comprehensive-guide-to-configuring-kibana-with-an-elasticsearch-cluster-integrating-aws-115de2c39883)


Monitoring systems can help give us confidence that our systems are running smoothly and, in the event of a system failure, can quickly provide appropriate context when diagnosing the root cause.

Things we want to monitor during and training and inference are different. During training we are concered about whether the loss is decreasing or not, whether the model is overfitting, etc.

But, during inference, We like to have confidence that our model is making correct predictions.

There are many reasons why a model can fail to make useful predictions:

- The underlying data distribution has shifted over time and the model has gone stale. i.e inference data characteristics is different from the data characteristics used to train the model.

- The inference data stream contains edge cases (not seen during model training). In this scenarios model might perform poorly or can lead to errors.

- The model was misconfigured in its production deployment. (Configuration issues are common)

In all of these scenarios, the model could still make a `successful` prediction from a service perspective, but the predictions will likely not be useful. Monitoring machine learning models can help us detect such scenarios and intervene (e.g. trigger a model retraining/deployment pipeline).

In this week, I will be going through the following topics:

- `Setting Up an Elasticsearch Cluster`

- `Installing and Configuring Kibana`

- `Integrating AWS CloudWatch Logs with Elasticsearch`

- `Creating an IAM Policy and Role`

- `Setting Up an AWS Lambda Function`

- `Configuring CloudWatch Logs Subscription Filters`

- `Automating Deployment with GitHub Actions`

- `Visualizing CloudWatch Logs in Kibana`
